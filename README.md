## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes (What I Learned)

This project was a deep dive into the foundational building blocks of HTML structure and semantics.

### 1. HTML File Structure & Boilerplate

- **Boilerplate:** Correctly setting up the basic HTML5 structure, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- **Metadata:** Understanding the importance of the `<meta>` tags, particularly `charset="UTF-8"` and `viewport` for character encMemoryg and basic responsiveness.
- **Page Title:** Using the `<title>` tag for browser tabs and search engine results.

### 2. Text and Content Structure

- **Headings:** Correct use of `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags for semantic structure and hierarchy.
- **Paragraphs:** Using `<p>` tags to define separate blocks of text.
- **Lists:** Implementing ordered lists (`<ol>`) for sequential steps (like baking instructions) and unordered lists (`<ul>`) for itemized lists (like ingredients).

### 3. Hyperlinks and Navigation

- **Anchor Tags (`<a>`):** Creating functional text links for navigation.
- **Relative Paths:** Mastering the use of relative file paths (e.g., `./recipes/` and `../index.html`) to link between pages within the same project structure.

### 4. Images and Resources

- **Image Tag (`<img>`):** Embedding images using the `src` attribute.
- **Attributes:** Understanding essential image attributes:
  - **`alt`:** Providing descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO.
  - **`width`:** Using this attribute for basic visual scaling control.
- **Inline vs. Block Elements:** Recognizing that the `<img>` tag is an **inline element**, which causes images to render side-by-side until a line break or CSS block styling is applied.
